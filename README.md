# My Project
**Reason for loop**
- first challenge: Used while loop because it repeats an action until condition is met (didn't know how many steps it woud take).
- second challenge: Used for loop because I knew the start and end of the divisor.
- third challenge: Used for loop because I number of iterations.

**Solutions**
- first solution: Generates the Collatz sequence for a given number, printing each step and counting how many steps until it reaches 1
- second solution: checks if a number is prime by testing all divisors from 2 to n-1. If a divisor is found, it's not prime. If no divisors are found, it's prime.
-third solution: Generates a 10Ã—10 multiplication table using nested loops with aligned rows and columns.

**AI Usage**
-Used Ai to understand Collatz Conjecture
-Set up SSH Key
- Understand indentation within loops, to debug.
